This is a very simple landing page I created using HTML, CSS and very basic JavaScript.

index.html has all the html code and can be opened via any web browser, it's styled using style.css. So all the fonts, sizing, colours, positioning is done there.
I used JavaScript only for the menu interaction, if you hit menu then it toggles to close and the side menu opens up i think its pretty neat.
